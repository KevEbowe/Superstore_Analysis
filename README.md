# Superstore_Analysis
U.S SUPERSTORE ANALYSIS

This analysis was done using the data collected from a superstore in the United States from 2014 to 2017. The superstore which is the subject of this analysis is a very large supermarket, often selling household goods, clothes, and electrical goods, as well as food. Superstores typically charge anywhere from 15 to 45 percent less than their smaller counterparts Performing this exploratory analysis, I generated some business questions that will be answered by analyzing the dataset using POSTGRESQL. This will help provide better insights into weak areas in terms of sales and profits generated by the superstore. Recommendations will be made as regards steps that might be taken to drive up sales and profit in these areas, which will enable the relevant stake-holders to make data-driven decisions to improving revenue created by the business.
The dataset consists of 21 columns and 9994 rows of data.

INSIGHTS FROM DATA ANALYSIS
Some of the insights gained from the analysis are:
•	The total number of customers that made purchases was 793
•	The total number of orders made was 9994
•	The most sales and profit was made from the western region, with the most sales and profits coming from the state of California
•	Texas recorded the least profits gained as no money was made from sales, rather losses were accrued despite recording the third most sales and discounts in the country.
•	Technology was the best-selling category in all but the western region, which had Furniture as its best-seller
•	A rise in profits generated was observed along the years, with the least profits recorded in 2014 and the highest in 2017.
•	There was a slight drop in sales in 2015 from the total sales recorded in 2014. Otherwise sales generated increased across the years.
•	Standard shipping was the most preferred shipping mode for customers out of first-class, same-day and second-class shipping and standard shipping methods, although first class was observed to be fastest shipping mode

RECOMMENDATIONS
•	Increase the focus on the western region, especially in California, since it generates the highest sales and profits. The company could consider expanding its operations in this region and increasing marketing efforts to attract more customers.
•	Review the sales and profits in Texas and identify the factors contributing to the losses despite recording high sales and discounts. It may be necessary to adjust pricing, product mix, or operational costs to improve profitability in this state.
•	Review the product mix across all regions and consider increasing the focus on the technology category since it is the best-selling category, except in the western region. The company may also consider diversifying its product mix in the western region to increase sales and profits.
•	The company should consider improving the delivery times for standard shipping since it is the most used. This can help to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty, as well as increase sales and profits for the company.
•	Evaluate the trend in profits generated over the years to identify the factors contributing to the rise in profits. This analysis will help the company to maintain profitability by focusing on the strategies that have worked in the past and identifying new opportunities for growth.
•	Monitor the sales trend across the years to identify any significant changes that may require adjustments in the company's operations, such as adjusting inventory levels or changing the pricing strategy.

LIMITATIONS
The dataset used for this analysis only contained historical data from 2014-2017. There were no recent data available to conduct my analysis.

DATA VISUALIZATION

Upon completion of my analysis, I proceeded to create a dashboard to visualize the insights gained from data exploration using SQL on PGAdmin.
